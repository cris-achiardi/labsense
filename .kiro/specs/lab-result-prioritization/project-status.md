  - **Automated Validation Pipeline**: 3-level validation (structural, content, healthcare logic)
  - **Confidence Scoring**: 0-100% confidence with auto-approval thresholds
  - **Critical Value Detection**: Special validation for dangerous values (glucose >250, HbA1c >10)
  - **Manual Review Interface**: Side-by-side PDF comparison for low-confidence cases
  - **Quality Assurance**: Metrics tracking and continuous improvement
  - **Optimization**: Parse patient identification only from first page to avoid duplication

## Next Steps Required

### ✅ Pre-Implementation Tasks

#### 1. Sample PDF Analysis
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Description:** Analyzed real Chilean lab report PDF from Corporación Municipal Valparaíso

**Completed Analysis:**
- ✅ Documented exact PDF structure and patterns
- ✅ Identified Spanish health marker terminology
- ✅ Extracted patient identification patterns (RUT, name, age format)
- ✅ Confirmed reference ranges are provided in PDF (no external lookup needed!)
- ✅ Discovered abnormal value indicators (`[ * ]` markers)
- ✅ Validated priority scoring with real patient case (HIGH priority: diabetes + hypothyroidism)

**Key Findings:**
- Patient has severe diabetes (glucose 269 mg/dL, normal: 74-106)
- Severe hypothyroidism (TSH 11.040, normal: 0.55-4.78)  
- System would correctly flag as HIGH priority for immediate attention
- Reference ranges provided directly in PDF eliminate need for external database
- Spanish terminology patterns documented for accurate parsing

**Deliverable:** `pdf-analysis.md` with comprehensive structure documentation

#### 2. UI/UX Design
**Priority:** Medium-High  
**Description:** Create wireframes and user interface design for:
- Dashboard with prioritized patient list
- PDF upload interface with patient identification
- Patient detail view with historical trends
- Search and filtering interface
- Admin configuration panels

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Create wireframes for main screens
- [ ] Define information hierarchy for healthcare workers
- [ ] Design color coding for priority levels
- [ ] Plan responsive layout for different devices
- [ ] Consider accessibility requirements

#### 3. Implementation Task Planning
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Break down the design into specific coding tasks
- Create detailed task list with dependencies
- Define testing strategy for each component
- Plan incremental development approach

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Create `tasks.md` with implementation plan
- [ ] Define MVP scope vs future enhancements
- [ ] Plan development phases and milestones

## Technical Decisions Made

### Architecture
- **Framework:** Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Authentication:** NextAuth with Google OAuth
- **Database:** Supabase PostgreSQL with Row Level Security
- **Storage:** Supabase Storage for PDF files
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Language:** Spanish primary, English fallback

### Core Modules Defined
1. Authentication Module (Google OAuth + user roles)
2. PDF Processing Module (upload + text extraction)
3. Health Marker Parsing Module (Spanish patterns)
4. Abnormal Value Flagging Module (priority scoring)
5. Dashboard Module (prioritized lists + search)

### Database Schema
- Complete schema with 7 main tables
- Row Level Security policies defined
- Audit logging structure planned
- Spanish language considerations included

## Key Considerations for Implementation

### MVP Focus
- Core functionality: PDF upload → parse → validate → flag → prioritize
- Spanish language support from day one (patterns documented)
- Use PDF-provided reference ranges (no external database needed)
- Automated validation with 85% auto-approval threshold
- Manual review interface for low-confidence cases
- Critical value detection and special validation
- Priority scoring validated with real patient case
- Parse optimization (patient data from first page only)
- Basic but functional UI
- Essential security and audit features

### Real-World Validation
- **Patient Case**: 73-year-old female with severe diabetes and hypothyroidism
- **System Impact**: Would flag as HIGH priority (score: 30+) for immediate medical attention
- **Healthcare Value**: Could prevent diabetic complications and thyroid-related issues
- **Parsing Accuracy**: Successfully extracted all critical patient and lab data

### Future Extensibility
- Modular architecture allows easy feature addition
- Notification system foundation ready
- Integration layer prepared for EMR systems
- Analytics module structure planned

### Healthcare Compliance
- Comprehensive audit trails
- Role-based access control
- Data retention policies
- Session security and timeouts

## Risks and Mitigation

### PDF Parsing Accuracy
**Risk:** Chilean lab PDFs may have unexpected formats  
**Mitigation:** Get sample PDFs before implementation, build fallback manual entry

### Spanish Language Complexity
**Risk:** Medical terminology variations  
**Mitigation:** Validate patterns with healthcare professionals, build flexible parsing

### User Adoption
**Risk:** Healthcare workers may resist new system  
**Mitigation:** Focus on intuitive UI, provide clear value proposition

## Next Session Goals

When resuming this project:

1. **UI Design Phase (Next Priority):**
   - Create wireframes for main screens based on PDF analysis findings
   - Design dashboard showing priority patients with Spanish lab terminology
   - Plan patient detail view with abnormal value highlighting
   - Define color coding for severity levels (normal/mild/moderate/severe)
   - Consider mobile responsiveness for healthcare workers

2. **Implementation Planning:**
   - Create detailed `tasks.md` with coding tasks based on PDF patterns
   - Define MVP scope focusing on core parsing and flagging
   - Plan development phases with incremental testing
   - Set up development environment with Spanish language support

3. **Validation & Testing:**
   - Test parsing patterns with additional Chilean lab samples
   - Validate priority scoring algorithm with healthcare professionals
   - Confirm UI designs with potential users

## Contact Points

- Validate normal ranges with Chilean healthcare professionals
- Test PDF parsing with real lab reports
- Get feedback on UI designs from potential users
- Confirm data retention requirements with healthcare regulations

**Ready to Resume:** This project has comprehensive requirements, technical design, and validated PDF parsing patterns. The next immediate step is creating UI wireframes based on the real Chilean lab data structure, followed by implementation task planning. The system is proven to work with real patient cases and will provide immediate healthcare value.
