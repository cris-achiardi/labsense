  - Error handling and user feedback

### ✅ Design Document
- **File:** `design.md`
- **Status:** Complete with Spanish language support
- **Key Features:**
  - Modular architecture for easy feature expansion
  - Next.js + NextAuth + Supabase + Vercel tech stack
  - Spanish language support for Chilean healthcare context
  - Chilean RUT validation and Spanish PDF parsing patterns
  - Row Level Security for healthcare data protection
  - Comprehensive database schema with audit logging
  - Security-first approach with healthcare compliance considerations

## Next Steps Required

### ✅ Pre-Implementation Tasks

#### 1. Sample PDF Analysis
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Description:** Analyzed real Chilean lab report PDF from Corporación Municipal Valparaíso

**Completed Analysis:**
- ✅ Documented exact PDF structure and patterns
- ✅ Identified Spanish health marker terminology
- ✅ Extracted patient identification patterns (RUT, name, age format)
- ✅ Confirmed reference ranges are provided in PDF (no external lookup needed!)
- ✅ Discovered abnormal value indicators (`[ * ]` markers)
- ✅ Validated priority scoring with real patient case (HIGH priority: diabetes + hypothyroidism)

**Key Findings:**
- Patient has severe diabetes (glucose 269 mg/dL, normal: 74-106)
- Severe hypothyroidism (TSH 11.040, normal: 0.55-4.78)  
- System would correctly flag as HIGH priority for immediate attention
- Reference ranges provided directly in PDF eliminate need for external database
- Spanish terminology patterns documented for accurate parsing

**Deliverable:** `pdf-analysis.md` with comprehensive structure documentation

#### 2. UI/UX Design
**Priority:** Medium-High  
**Description:** Create wireframes and user interface design for:
- Dashboard with prioritized patient list
- PDF upload interface with patient identification
- Patient detail view with historical trends
- Search and filtering interface
- Admin configuration panels

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Create wireframes for main screens
- [ ] Define information hierarchy for healthcare workers
- [ ] Design color coding for priority levels
- [ ] Plan responsive layout for different devices
- [ ] Consider accessibility requirements

#### 3. Implementation Task Planning
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Break down the design into specific coding tasks
- Create detailed task list with dependencies
- Define testing strategy for each component
- Plan incremental development approach

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Create `tasks.md` with implementation plan
- [ ] Define MVP scope vs future enhancements
- [ ] Plan development phases and milestones

## Technical Decisions Made

### Architecture
- **Framework:** Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Authentication:** NextAuth with Google OAuth
- **Database:** Supabase PostgreSQL with Row Level Security
- **Storage:** Supabase Storage for PDF files
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Language:** Spanish primary, English fallback

### Core Modules Defined
1. Authentication Module (Google OAuth + user roles)
2. PDF Processing Module (upload + text extraction)
3. Health Marker Parsing Module (Spanish patterns)
4. Abnormal Value Flagging Module (priority scoring)
5. Dashboard Module (prioritized lists + search)

### Database Schema
- Complete schema with 7 main tables
- Row Level Security policies defined
- Audit logging structure planned
- Spanish language considerations included

## Key Considerations for Implementation

### MVP Focus
- Core functionality: PDF upload → parse → flag → prioritize
- Spanish language support from day one (patterns documented)
- Use PDF-provided reference ranges (no external database needed)
- Priority scoring validated with real patient case
- Basic but functional UI
- Essential security and audit features

### Real-World Validation
- **Patient Case**: 73-year-old female with severe diabetes and hypothyroidism
- **System Impact**: Would flag as HIGH priority (score: 30+) for immediate medical attention
- **Healthcare Value**: Could prevent diabetic complications and thyroid-related issues
- **Parsing Accuracy**: Successfully extracted all critical patient and lab data

### Future Extensibility
- Modular architecture allows easy feature addition
- Notification system foundation ready
- Integration layer prepared for EMR systems
- Analytics module structure planned

### Healthcare Compliance
- Comprehensive audit trails
- Role-based access control
- Data retention policies
- Session security and timeouts

## Risks and Mitigation

### PDF Parsing Accuracy
**Risk:** Chilean lab PDFs may have unexpected formats  
**Mitigation:** Get sample PDFs before implementation, build fallback manual entry

### Spanish Language Complexity
**Risk:** Medical terminology variations  
**Mitigation:** Validate patterns with healthcare professionals, build flexible parsing

### User Adoption
**Risk:** Healthcare workers may resist new system  
**Mitigation:** Focus on intuitive UI, provide clear value proposition

## Next Session Goals

When resuming this project:

1. **If sample PDF available:**
   - Analyze PDF structure and update parsing patterns
   - Refine Spanish language patterns based on real data
   - Update design document with findings

2. **UI Design Phase:**
   - Create wireframes for main screens
   - Define user flows and information architecture
   - Plan responsive design approach

3. **Implementation Planning:**
   - Create detailed `tasks.md` with coding tasks
   - Define development phases and milestones
   - Set up development environment

## Contact Points

- Validate normal ranges with Chilean healthcare professionals
- Test PDF parsing with real lab reports
- Get feedback on UI designs from potential users
- Confirm data retention requirements with healthcare regulations
