**Benefits Achieved:**
- ✅ Accessibility compliance built-in (WCAG standards)
- ✅ Professional healthcare-appropriate interface
- ✅ Consistent design language across all screens
- ✅ Responsive design works on all devices
- ✅ Rapid development without custom CSS work

**AI Development Benefits:**
- ✅ Eliminated UI interpretation friction for Kiro
- ✅ Provided explicit component library and design tokens
- ✅ Enabled production-ready AI-generated components
- ✅ Allowed UI refinements without breaking design consistency
- ✅ Let AI focus on healthcare functionality rather than design patterns
