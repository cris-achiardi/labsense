# LabSense - Kiro Hackathon Project

## üèÜ Project Overview

**LabSense** is a comprehensive Chilean Lab Result Prioritization System built during the Kiro Hackathon. The system automates the processing of Chilean lab reports to help public primary care facilities prioritize patient care efficiently with limited resources.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Chilean public primary care centers manually review thousands of lab reports daily. Critical abnormal values (diabetes, liver issues, thyroid problems) can be missed or delayed, leading to poor patient outcomes. Healthcare workers spend hours manually reviewing reports that could be processed automatically.

## üí° Solution

An intelligent lab result prioritization system that:
- **Automatically extracts** patient data and lab values from Spanish PDFs
- **Detects abnormal values** using Chilean medical standards
- **Prioritizes patients** based on severity of abnormalities
- **Provides safety nets** for critical values that could be life-threatening
- **Reduces manual workload** from hours to minutes
