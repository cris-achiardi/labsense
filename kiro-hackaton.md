# LabSense - Kiro Hackathon Project

## üèÜ Project Overview

**LabSense** is a comprehensive Chilean Lab Result Prioritization System built during the Kiro Hackathon. The system automates the processing of Chilean lab reports to help public primary care facilities prioritize patient care efficiently with limited resources.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Chilean public primary care centers manually review thousands of lab reports daily. Critical abnormal values (diabetes, liver issues, thyroid problems) can be missed or delayed, leading to poor patient outcomes. Healthcare workers spend hours manually reviewing reports that could be processed automatically.

## üí° Solution

An intelligent lab result prioritization system that:
- **Automatically extracts** patient data and lab values from Spanish PDFs
- **Detects abnormal values** using Chilean medical standards
- **Prioritizes patients** based on severity of abnormalities
- **Provides safety nets** for critical values that could be life-threatening
- **Reduces manual workload** from hours to minutes

## üöß Biggest Challenges

### üìÑ **Data Extraction: The Primary Technical Challenge**

The biggest challenge in LabSense development was **correctly extracting data from Chilean lab report PDFs**. Even with digitally generated PDFs, the documents are designed primarily for human readability, presenting significant format issues when parsing and normalizing the data to be useful and precise for automated processing.

#### Key Data Extraction Challenges:

1. **Human-Centric Design vs. Machine Processing**
   - PDFs optimized for visual presentation, not data extraction
   - Inconsistent spacing, alignment, and formatting across different labs
   - Connected words due to PDF text rendering: `GLICEMIA EN AYUNO (BASAL)269(mg/dL)`
   - Text fragments scattered across multiple lines

2. **Chilean Medical Format Complexities**
   - **5-column structure variations**: LAB NAME | Result | Unit | Normal Range | Method
   - **Embedded results in contaminated fields**: TRIGLICERIDOS valor referencia containing COLESTEROL TOTAL, HDL, LDL, VLDL results
   - **Multi-level normal ranges**: TRIGLICERIDOS with 4 different range categories, COLESTEROL with 3 levels
   - **Header/footer contamination**: Patient information repeated on all 13 pages polluting extraction

3. **Precision Requirements for Healthcare**
   - **Zero tolerance for missed critical values** (life-threatening conditions)
   - **High confidence thresholds** (95%+) required for auto-approval
   - **Multiple result types**: Numeric (269 mg/dL), qualitative (No reactivo), calculated ratios, microscopy observations
   - **Spanish medical terminology** with accents and abbreviations

#### Solutions Developed:

- **Simplified LAB NAME + RESULT Extraction**: Focused approach achieving 48 ‚Üí 61 results (+27% improvement)
- **9 Comprehensive Extraction Patterns**: Handle connected words, embedded results, multiple formats
- **Header/Footer Contamination Cleaning**: Remove repeated patient info across pages
- **Chilean Lab Format Database**: 68+ lab specifications with expected units, methods, ranges
- **Smart Lab Name Validation**: Filter out non-lab text and validate ALL-CAPS patterns
- **Multiple Extraction Strategies**: Group-aware parsing + fallback extractors for maximum coverage

#### Current Achievement:
- **‚≠ê PRODUCTION READY**: 100% confidence extraction with 60 lab results
- **‚≠ê COMPLETE CLINICAL ASSESSMENT**: All patient metadata with timestamps extracted
- **‚≠ê SPANISH SEVERITY SYSTEM**: Dynamic calculation using clinical percentages
- **‚≠ê CLEAN ARCHITECTURE**: Single comprehensive extractor, eliminated conflicts
- **‚≠ê ACCURATE SEVERITY**: 3 cr√≠tico, 1 severo, 1 moderado, 3 leve, 52 normal results
- **‚≠ê REAL PATIENT VALIDATION**: Tested against actual 13-page Chilean lab comprehensive panels

The data extraction challenge required innovative parsing strategies, extensive pattern recognition, and deep understanding of Chilean medical report structures to achieve production-ready accuracy for healthcare applications.

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### Comprehensive Test Suites
