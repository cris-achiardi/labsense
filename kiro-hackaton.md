# LabSense - Code with Kiro Hackathon Submission

## General Info

### Project Name
**LabSense** - Intelligent Lab Result Prioritization System

### Elevator Pitch
Intelligent lab result analysis for Chilean healthcare - automatically flags critical patients, turning hours of manual review into minutes of focused care.

## Project Details

### Project Story

#### Inspiration
At Chile's public primary care centers, routine blood tests expire after 12 months‚Äîeven when initial results already show high glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, liver enzymes or other health markers. Patients can wait an entire year for a retest, during which untreated risk factors may progress to diabetes, heart disease, kidney failure or stroke. Meanwhile, care teams spend hours each day manually reviewing thousands of lab reports. A job an automation could finish in minutes. This needless cycle delays treatment, worsens health outcomes, increases public healthcare spending (funds that could go toward direct patient care, facility upgrades or preventive programs) and keeps clinicians tied up in administrative work instead of caring for people.

#### What it does

LabSense is a comprehensive web application designed specifically for Chilean public primary care centers that revolutionizes how healthcare workers handle laboratory results. Here's what the system accomplishes:

**üîç Intelligent PDF Processing**
- Automatically extracts patient information and lab results from Spanish-language PDF reports
- Recognizes Chilean-specific formats including RUT identification, Spanish medical terminology, and local lab structures
- Parses complex multi-page reports while avoiding data duplication
- Handles various sample types (SUERO, SANGRE TOTAL, ORINA) and different laboratory formats

**‚ö° Automated Health Marker Analysis**
- Identifies critical health markers including glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, liver enzymes, HbA1c, TSH, and more
- Uses reference ranges provided directly in the PDF documents (no external database needed)
- Detects abnormal values using Chilean medical standards and laboratory-specific normal ranges
- Recognizes abnormal indicators like `[ * ]` markers that Chilean labs use to flag concerning values

**üö® Smart Priority Scoring**
- Calculates priority scores based on severity and number of abnormal values
- Assigns severity levels: normal, mild, moderate, severe
- Applies special weighting for critical markers like diabetes indicators
- Flags patients requiring immediate medical attention (like our test case: 73-year-old with glucose 269 mg/dL and severe hypothyroidism)

**üìä Healthcare Worker Dashboard**
- Displays prioritized patient lists sorted by urgency (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW priority)
- Shows patient identification (name, RUT), abnormal markers, and priority levels in Spanish
- Provides search and filtering capabilities by patient name, RUT, date ranges, and specific health markers
- Enables quick status updates when patients are contacted or processed

**üìà Historical Tracking & Trends**
- Maintains complete patient lab history for trend analysis
- Tracks changes in health markers over time with visual indicators (improving, worsening, stable)
- Helps healthcare workers make informed decisions based on patient progression
- Supports long-term patient care management

**üîê Healthcare-Grade Security**
- Implements Google OAuth authentication with role-based access control
- Provides comprehensive audit trails tracking who accessed what patient data and when
- Includes automatic session timeouts and secure logout for shared devices
- Maintains data retention policies compliant with healthcare regulations

**‚úÖ Intelligent Validation System**
- Uses automated confidence scoring to validate parsing accuracy
- Auto-approves high-confidence extractions (85%+) to reduce manual work
- Flags medium-confidence cases (70-84%) for optional spot-checks
- Requires manual review for low-confidence extractions (<70%)
- Always validates critical values (glucose >250, HbA1c >10) regardless of confidence
- Provides side-by-side PDF comparison interface for manual review cases

**üåê Spanish Language Native Support**
- Built from the ground up for Spanish-speaking healthcare workers
- Recognizes Chilean medical terminology and date formats
- Handles Spanish health marker names (glucosa, colesterol, triglic√©ridos, etc.)
- Provides user interface entirely in Spanish with appropriate medical terminology

**üì± Modern Web Architecture**
- Built with Next.js for fast, responsive performance
- Uses Supabase for secure, scalable database and file storage
- Implements Row Level Security for patient data protection
- Designed for easy deployment and maintenance

**Real-World Impact Example:**
In our analysis of a real Chilean lab report, LabSense successfully identified a 73-year-old female patient with:
- Severe diabetes (glucose 269 mg/dL, normal: 74-106)
- Poor long-term glucose control (HbA1c 11.8%, normal: 4-6)
- Severe hypothyroidism (TSH 11.040, normal: 0.55-4.78)

The system correctly flagged this as HIGH priority, enabling immediate medical intervention that could prevent diabetic complications, cardiovascular disease, and thyroid-related health issues. This demonstrates how LabSense transforms administrative burden into life-saving healthcare efficiency.

**System Benefits:**
- **For Healthcare Workers**: Reduces manual review time from hours to minutes, focuses attention on patients who need immediate care

LabSense doesn't just digitize lab results. It intelligently prioritizes human health, ensuring that no critical value goes unnoticed and no patient waits unnecessarily for life-changing medical care. The current rule-based intelligent system provides immediate value while establishing the foundation for advanced AI capabilities as the platform scales.

#### How we built it

**Team Composition**
- **Juli**: Senior backend developer with expertise in similar healthcare projects
- **Cris**: Product designer with basic HTML/CSS knowledge and experience in AI-assisted coding frameworks
- **Background**: Both team members work at a health tech company serving the US market, bringing relevant domain knowledge to Chilean healthcare challenges

**Development Approach with Kiro**

**Requirements and Planning Phase**
- Used Kiro's structured workflow to systematically define 14 comprehensive requirements
- Leveraged our health tech experience to identify critical compliance needs (audit trails, data retention, security)
- Applied EARS format for acceptance criteria to ensure clear, testable requirements
- Iteratively refined requirements through Kiro-assisted conversations

**Technical Architecture Design**
- Selected proven tech stack based on team expertise: Next.js, Supabase, Vercel
- Used Kiro to design TypeScript interfaces and database schemas
- Applied healthcare compliance patterns from our professional experience
- Designed modular architecture to support future development phases

**Real-World Data Analysis**
- Obtained actual Chilean lab report PDF for analysis
- Used Kiro to help parse and extract text content from the PDF sample
- Manually analyzed the structure to identify key patterns:
  - Patient identification format (Chilean RUT: 7.236.426-0)
  - 5-column lab structure: Examen|Resultado|Unidad|Valor de Referencia|M√©todo
  - Abnormal value indicators (`[ * ]` markers)
  - Spanish medical terminology and date formats
- Validated approach with real patient case showing severe diabetes and hypothyroidism

**System Design Process**
- Designed validation pipeline with 3-level approach (structural, content, healthcare logic)
- Created confidence scoring system with practical thresholds (85% auto-approval)
- Planned manual review interface for edge cases
- Incorporated Spanish language support throughout the system

**Documentation and Specs**
- Created comprehensive project documentation using Kiro's guidance
- Maintained detailed specs: requirements, technical design, PDF analysis, project status
- Documented parsing patterns and validation strategies for implementation

**Key Design Decision: Radix UI as Design System**
Before starting implementation, we made the strategic decision to adopt Radix UI Themes as our complete design system. This choice provided several critical advantages:

- **Accessibility First**: Radix UI components are built with WCAG compliance from the ground up, ensuring our healthcare application meets accessibility standards without additional work
- **Design Consistency**: Pre-built component system with consistent spacing, typography, and color schemes eliminates design inconsistencies
- **Rapid Development**: Ready-to-use components (Cards, Buttons, Badges, etc.) allowed us to focus on healthcare logic rather than UI implementation
- **Professional Appearance**: Clean, modern interface that looks professional for healthcare workers without custom CSS development
- **Theme Customization**: Mint accent color and full radius configuration creates a cohesive, healthcare-appropriate visual identity
- **Responsive by Default**: All components work seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices
- **TypeScript Integration**: Full TypeScript support reduces development errors and improves code quality

This decision meant our application had a polished, accessible, professional interface from day one of implementation, allowing us to concentrate on the complex healthcare-specific features rather than UI design and accessibility compliance.

**Critical AI Development Advantage**: Having an explicit design system in place was essential for effective AI-assisted coding with Kiro. Without a defined design system, AI models struggle to interpret UI requirements and often produce inconsistent or incomplete interfaces. Common friction points in AI-assisted development include:

- **Ambiguous UI Specifications**: AI models have to guess at styling, spacing, and component choices
- **Inconsistent Design Decisions**: Each AI interaction may produce different visual approaches
- **Design System Fragmentation**: Even with tools like Figma MCP, translating designs to code creates interpretation gaps
- **Iterative Design Complexity**: Modifying AI-generated UI often breaks design consistency

By establishing Radix UI Themes upfront, we provided Kiro with:
- **Explicit Component Library**: Clear, documented components to use (Card, Button, Badge, etc.)
- **Consistent Design Tokens**: Defined spacing, colors, and typography rules
- **Predictable Patterns**: Established conventions for layout and interaction
- **Modification Framework**: Ability to refine AI-generated UI without breaking the design system

This approach enabled Kiro to generate production-ready UI components that we could then refine and customize while maintaining design consistency. The AI could focus on functionality and layout logic rather than inventing design patterns, resulting in faster development and higher quality output.
